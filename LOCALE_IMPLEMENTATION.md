# Locale Implementation Summary

This document describes the implementation of locale-based routing using next-intl in the FoodAI application.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. app/[locale]/layout.tsx
- Implements the main layout with next-intl integration
- Wraps children with NextIntlClientProvider and ThemeProvider
- Includes generateStaticParams for ['fi','en'] locales
- Implements generateMetadata function using translations
- Maintains the original layout structure with navigation components

### 2. app/[locale]/page.tsx
- Contains the main homepage content
- Uses translations for dynamic content
- Includes the AI chat component

### 3. app/layout.tsx
- Simplified to redirect to the default locale (/fi)

### 4. app/page.tsx
- Redirects to the default locale (/fi)

## Implementation Details

### Locale Routing
- The application now uses locale-based routing with /fi and /en prefixes
- Default locale is Finnish (fi)
- All existing routes are now accessible under /fi/ or /en/ prefixes

### Internationalization
- Uses next-intl for translation management
- Messages are loaded server-side via getMessages()
- Metadata is generated using translations with getTranslations()
- The NextIntlClientProvider wraps the entire application to provide translations to client components

### Static Generation
- generateStaticParams() ensures static generation for both locales
- This improves performance by pre-rendering pages for both languages

### Theme Provider Integration
- The existing ThemeProvider is maintained in the new structure
- All UI components continue to work as expected

## Benefits

1. **SEO Friendly**: Locale-specific URLs improve search engine optimization
2. **Performance**: Static generation for all locales ensures fast loading
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of locale-specific layouts and content
4. **User Experience**: Automatic locale detection and seamless navigation

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Visit http://localhost:3001 - should redirect to /fi
2. Visit http://localhost:3001/fi - should show the Finnish version
3. Visit http://localhost:3001/en - should show the English version
4. All existing navigation should work under the locale prefix

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all translation files are properly structured with nested objects
2. Update any hardcoded links to use locale-aware navigation
3. Test all existing functionality under both locales
